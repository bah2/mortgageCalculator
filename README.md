# mortgageCalculator


This code is a Java program that calculates the monthly or bi-weekly mortgage payments for a given loan amount, annual interest rate, term in years, and down payment. The program prompts the user to input these values using a Scanner object, and then uses the Loan class to perform the calculations and output the results. The program first calculates the monthly interest rate and the total number of payments, then it uses the formula for calculating mortgage payments to compute the monthly payment. If the down payment is less than 20% of the house price, the program adds a PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance) fee to the monthly payments. The program also calculates the total payback of the mortgage using the formula of total payment = monthly payment * total number of payments. Finally, the program uses the NumberFormat class to format the results as currency.
